# MLP-mnist

This is a Python code for training a Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network on mnist data set. 
We have considered the limitation of 10,000 training parameters. 
The network includes 4 layers (2 hidden layers). 
Number of neurons in each layer:
input: 28*28
hidden 1: 12
hidden 2: 25
output: 10
The validation accuracy is 94.5 percent.
